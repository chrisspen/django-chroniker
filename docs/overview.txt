.. _overview:

Installation
============

Installing ``chroniker`` is pretty simple.  First add it into
``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py`` file.  If you're running a version
of Django older than revision 9739 (basically anything after 1.0 but before
1.1), then you'll need to add the following to your project's ``urls.py``::
  
	url(r'^admin/chroniker/job/(?P<pk>\d+)/run/$',
		'chroniker.views.job_run', name="chroniker_job_run"),

.. note::

	Make sure you place this *BEFORE* the root admin site include.
	
Your ``urls.py`` should then look something like::

  ...
  url(r'^admin/chroniker/job/(?P<pk>\d+)/run/$',
	  'chroniker.views.job_run', name="admin_chroniker_job_run"),
  ('^admin/(.*)', admin.site.root),
  ...

After this run ``syncdb``.  The only thing left to do is set up a periodic call
to run the jobs.

If you're using `cron`, the following example can be added to your `crontab`::

    * * * * * /path/to/your/project/manage.py cron

You're done!  Every minute ``cron`` will check to see if you have any pending
jobs and if you do they'll be run.  No more mucking about with your
``crontab``.

If you have a more complicated setup where ``manage.py`` might not work by
default see the section below on installing ``chroniker`` in a virtual
environment.

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0
	Added ``chroniker`` script

If your project does not reside within your global python path then the above
crontab snippet won't work.  Instead, ``django-chroniker`` now comes with a
script called ``chroniker`` (located at :file:`bin/chroniker`) that
provides an easy way to run all jobs that are due, like so::

	/path/to/bin/chroniker -p /path/to/your/project

For use in a virtual environment, see below.


Within a Virtual Environment
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0
	Added ``chroniker`` script

When running ``setup.py`` a script named ``chroniker`` should get installed
into your ``bin`` directory.  This script is meant to make it really easy to
call your ``django-chroniker`` jobs.  For extended usage information, see
the output from the script.  Here is an example of how to use this script from
within the system's crontab::

	* * * * * /path/to/bin/chroniker -e /path/to/ve/bin/activate_this.py -p /path/to/your/project

.. note::
	This script is new and should be considered experimental.  Please report
	any bugs to the `issue tracker`_.

	.. _issue tracker: http://bitbucket.org/wnielson/django-chroniker/issues

.. deprecated:: 0.2.0
	``chroniker.sh`` has been removed.  Use ``chroniker`` instead (see
	above).

If you're using a virtual environment, setting up ``chroniker `` involves a
bit more work, but not by much.  Included is a script called
``chroniker.sh``.  Copy this file to your project directory.

You should open up this script and modify the path to your virtual
environment's ``activate`` script::

    $PROJECT_PATH"/../../../ve/bin/activate"

Make sure that this file is executable and then update your ``crontab`` to
execute the script.  Running `crontab -e`::

    * * * * * /path/to/your/project/chroniker.sh /path/to/your/project

Make sure that you pass ``/path/to/your/project`` to the script as the first
argument.  This will ensure that ``cron`` will not have any problems finding
your project directory.

Using Chroniker
=================

If you've completed the above steps, you're all done.  Now you can add some
jobs to the system.  Remember, ``chroniker`` is designed to run any installed
``django-admin`` management command and it accommodates command-line arguments
as well.

Cleaning Out Old Job Logs
-------------------------

If you'd like an easy way to delete old job logs, there is a management command
that will do it for you: ``cron_clean``.  You can use it like so::

  python manage.py cron_clean [weeks|days|hours|minutes] [integer]

So, if you want to remove all jobs that are older than a week, you can do the
following::

  python manage.py cron_clean weeks 1

Since this is just a simple management command, you can also easily add it to
``chroniker``, via the admin, so that it will clear out old logs
automatically.

Other Useful Bits
-----------------

There is anther included management command, ``cronserver`` which can be used
to test the periodic running of jobs.  It'll print out information to the
screen about which job are due and also run them.  Here is how you would use
it::

  python manage.py cronserver

This will start up a process that will check for and run any jobs that are due
every 60 seconds.  The interval can be changed by simply passing the number of
seconds in between runs.  For example, to make the process check for due jobs
every 2 minutes, you would run::

  python manage.py cronserver 120
